The Scientific Python project started as an initiative from Stéfan van der Walt and Jarrod Millman, to help coordinate the Scientific Python ecosystem and grow the community. Their idea is to improve communication between projects in the ecosystem, (get projects talking to one another) to plan strategies about their joint future, and to make that future a reality.

## Why is this important?

Initially, the Scientific Python developer community was small and it was easy to organize meetings to discuss important aspects of the ecosystem and take joint decisions. However, over the years the community has grown quickly and it has become harder, if not impossible, to have these meetings with all the members of the ecosystem and take decisions together. Each project now has their own community and there has been a lack of coordination that impacts negatively the users of the different tools. In the end, it is a fact that the different projects depend on one another, so it just makes sense to have some sort of coordination between them.

## How are we doing this?

### SPECs

The first aim of the project, is to have a mechanism through which the community can establish cross-project policies. These policy documents are called [SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/): Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination documents. And they function similarly to PEPs, NEPs, SKIPs, or any of the other enhancement proposals—except that they will be relevant to multiple projects in the ecosystem.

These documents will be recommendations written up by the community, and their authority will derive from endorsement by popular libraries. Some of them are already in progress and many are on the way!

### Shared infrastructure

The project also aims to provide a common engineering infrastructure to help maintainers. Some of the tools that are part of this are a [theme](https://github.com/scientific-python/scientific-python-hugo-theme) for the project websites, which is already been used by some of the projects (NumPy and SciPy), a self-hosted privacy-friendly web analytics platform, a shared [discussions forum](https://discuss.scientific-python.org), a [Scientific Python blog](https://blog.scientific-python.org), and [project development statistics](https://devstats.scientific-python.org).

### Developer events

Another idea of the project is to organize events where developers can meet to discuss relevant topics of interest across several packages. They will be recorded and shared on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/scientificpythonorg) so that everyone has access to them. Up to the moment, there has been two of these events, the first involved API dispatching for core projects and the second involved alt-text for improved accessibility. There are two more coming soon, a Domain Stacks summit and a Sparse Array summit but we hope to have a lot more of these throughout the year.

### Documentation

Documentation is a key aspect of every Python software project. Thus, we want to have a central landing place for information that will help users and contributors better understand the ecosystem. The [scientific-python.org](https://scientific-python.org) website contains resources that we hope will be used and adopted by many of the projects. These include videos that orient newcomers to the ecosystem, interviews that introduce some of the members of our community and how they contribute, and demos, which give an overview of the problem solving workflow in the Scientific Python ecosystem.

### Community outreach

Outreach and engagement are also important ways of growing our community. Nowadays, [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/scientific.python), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/scientific_py), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/scientific.python), and [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@scientific.python) are a big part of people's lives. In order to stay connected, we are using social media to share our content and interact directly with users and developers. We have released content in every social media channel and achieved great engagement from the community.

## Who is behind this?

The short answer: Anyone who wants to be. The long answer: We are a community of volunteers from different Scientific Python packages of the ecosystem. There are several teams in place working on the different aspects of the project and though it is leaded by Jarrod Millman and Stéfan van der Walt, there has been a lot of people involved in making this possible from [content creators](https://blog.scientific-python.org/about/), to content reviewers and [community managers](https://scientific-python.org/about/).

Currently there are eight [projects](https://scientific-python.org/specs/core-projects/) endorsing the SPECs: IPython, Matplotlib, NetworkX, NumPy, pandas, scikit-image, scikit-learn, and SciPy. However there are people from many more projects participating in our discussion forum, writing blogs or contributing to the community somehow. We welcome everyone to be part of the community and contribute their bit however they can.

## What am I doing here?

For the past couple of months I have been a community manager of the project. This includes recording docummentation videos for the website, recording developer interviews for our YouTube channel, presenting talks in conferences, hosting developer events, creating content for our Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and Twitter and many other things that I never thought I would do.

Why? Because I believe in this. Jarrod and Stefan reached out to me last year, inviting me to be part of this amazing idea and I was honored and very grateful. I wasn't sure that I could do it, but now I find myself here and I know that this is the right place for me. Not because I have a lot of experience in these things (I had actually never even used TikTok before joining the project), but because I care. I have learned the importance of building community and while the Scientific Python tools are amazing, what makes the difference is the community around them and I'm greatful to be able to help make this community great.

I have learned a lot from the Scientific Python ecosystem by being a community manager, I have met a lot of wonderful people and I have seen what people can do with the tools that the ecosystem offers. So, my take: The Scientific Python project is a great bet. Open source Scientific Python is about much more than coding, it is about collaborating, teaching, and communicating so unifying the community and promoting the integration of the projects sounds like the perfect path to follow in order to get the most out of the ecosystem.
